# Stocks Decision Support Tool

This project is a Python-based tool that evaluates whether a stock is a **BUY**, **HOLD**, or **NOT BUY** based on both **fundamental** and **technical** analysis.

It uses:
- [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) to fetch financial and price data
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data handling
- [ta](https://technical-analysis-library-in-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for technical indicators
- Basic scoring logic to generate investment decisions
